# Hi, I'm Anılcan! 👋

**Software Consultant** & **AI Enthusiast** | İzmir, Türkiye 🇹🇷

I've been living in the terminal since 2014. Over the last 12+ years, my role has evolved significantly: I used to write every single line of code myself; now, I architect systems and train AI agents to write them for me.

I love being on the **production** side of technology. Currently, I am leading e-commerce development at **[The Despatch Company](https://thedespatchcompany.com)**, while aiming to build the future of developer experience with **LLMs**, **Agentic Workflows**, and the **FlutterSDK** ecosystem.

### ⚡️ The Offline World

When I step away from the screen, I keep the "Maker" spirit alive in the physical world:

* **Maker Spirit:** I design my own PCBs, solder circuits, and love getting my hands dirty with electronics.
* **Home Automation:** My house doesn't just switch lights on; it talks to me. (Powered by Home Assistant & ESPHome).
* **3D Design & Print:** If I need a part, I don't buy it. I model it in Fusion 360 and print it.
