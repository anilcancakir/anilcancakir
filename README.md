# Hi, I'm Anılcan! 👋

**Lead Developer** & **AI Enthusiast** | İzmir, Türkiye 🇹🇷

I've been living in the terminal since 2014. Over the last 12+ years, my role has evolved significantly: I used to write every single line of code myself; now, I architect systems and train AI agents to write them for me.

I love being on the **production** side of technology. Currently, I am leading e-commerce development at **[The Despatch Company](https://thedespatchcompany.com)**, while aiming to build the future of developer experience with **LLMs**, **Agentic Workflows**, and the **FlutterSDK** ecosystem.

### 🧠 AI & Open Source Focus

Lately, I'm dedicating my time to redefining Developer Experience (DX) through Artificial Intelligence. I build tools that empower AI agents to be more capable:

* **[skillsmp-mcp-server](https://github.com/anilcancakir/skillsmp-mcp-server)** A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server based on the SkillsMP API, allowing AI agents to discover and learn new capabilities on the fly.
* **[claude-code-plugins](https://github.com/anilcancakir/claude-code-plugins)** A suite of plugins and toolsets I developed to supercharge the Claude Code ecosystem.
* **[my-claude-code](https://github.com/anilcancakir/my-claude-code):** My personal configuration and workflows for an AI-native development environment.

### 🚀 FlutterSDK: Ship Your Vision.

I am architecting a unified "Operating System" for the fragmented Flutter world—combining Frameworks, Cloud, and AI under one roof.

**Pillar I: Intelligence & Creation**
* **✨ [FlutterSDK AI](https://fluttersdk.com)** `Closed Beta` <br> Not just another LLM. A generative engine that understands the Magic & Wind architecture to turn prompts into production apps.
* **⚡️ [FlutterSDK Editor](https://editor.fluttersdk.com)** `Alpha Test` <br> A cloud-based IDE offering instant previews and deep integration with the ecosystem.

**Pillar II: Frameworks (Open Source)**
* **🔵 [Wind UI](https://wind.fluttersdk.com)** `Alpha Test (v1)` <br> The ticket out of "Widget Hell." A utility-first UI library inspired by Tailwind CSS principles.
* **🟣 [Magic](https://magic.fluttersdk.com)** `Closed Beta` <br> Laravel-like elegance for Flutter. A full-stack framework featuring Eloquent ORM and Dependency Injection.

**Pillar III: Infrastructure & Community**
* **☁️ Cloud Kit (BaaS) / Academy / Jobs** `Coming Soon 🚧` <br> The backend infrastructure and community platforms are currently under construction.

### ⚡️ The Offline World

When I step away from the screen, I keep the "Maker" spirit alive in the physical world:

* **Maker Spirit:** I design my own PCBs, solder circuits, and love getting my hands dirty with electronics.
* **Home Automation:** My house doesn't just switch lights on; it talks to me. (Powered by Home Assistant & ESPHome).
* **3D Design & Print:** If I need a part, I don't buy it. I model it in Fusion 360 and print it.
